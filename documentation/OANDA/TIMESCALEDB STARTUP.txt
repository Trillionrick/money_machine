Here's how to restart everything after shutting down: 

TIMESCALEDB

  Quick Start After Shutdown

  One command to start everything:
  ./START_COLLECTING.sh

  That script automatically:
  - ✅ Checks if the database container is running (starts it if not)
  - ✅ Stops any old collector processes
  - ✅ Starts a fresh data collector
  - ✅ Verifies everything is working

  Manual Step-by-Step (if needed)

  1. Start the database container:
  docker start trading_timescaledb

  2. Verify it's running:
  docker ps | grep trading_timescaledb

  3. Start the data collector:
  ./START_COLLECTING.sh

  4. Verify data is flowing:
  tail -f logs/forex_collector.log
  # Press Ctrl+C to exit

  Auto-Start on Boot (Optional)

  If you want the system to start automatically when your machine boots:

  Option 1: Auto-start Docker container
  # Update container to restart automatically
  docker update --restart unless-stopped trading_timescaledb

  Option 2: Create a systemd service (Linux/WSL2)

● Write(scripts/forex-collector.service)
  ⎿  Error writing file

● Simple Shutdown/Startup Procedure

  When Shutting Down

  Option A: Leave it running
  - The collector and database will keep running even if you close your terminal
  - They'll survive until you actually shut down the machine

  Option B: Stop cleanly before shutdown
  # Stop collector
  kill $(cat logs/collector.pid)

  # Stop database (optional - Docker will stop it automatically on shutdown)
  docker stop trading_timescaledb

  When Starting Up Again

  Just run:
  cd /mnt/c/Users/catty/Desktop/money_machine
  ./START_COLLECTING.sh

  That's it! The script handles everything.

  Auto-Restart Docker Container

  To make the database container auto-start with Docker:

  docker update --restart unless-stopped trading_timescaledb

  Now whenever Docker starts, your database will automatically start too.

  Create a Simple Startup Alias (Recommended)

  Add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:

  alias start-forex='cd /mnt/c/Users/catty/Desktop/money_machine && ./START_COLLECTING.sh'

  Then after rebooting, just type:
  start-forex

  And everything fires up!

  Check Status Anytime

  # Is the database running?
  docker ps | grep trading_timescaledb

  # Is the collector running?
  ps aux | grep forex_collector

  # Or check the PID file
  if [ -f logs/collector.pid ]; then
      ps -p $(cat logs/collector.pid) > /dev/null && echo "✅ Collector running" || echo "❌ Collector stopped"        
  fi

  Bottom line: After any shutdown, just run ./START_COLLECTING.sh and you're back in business!

● 🔥 THAT'S LIVE DATA FLOWING!

  You just watched real-time forex prices update 5 times over 15 seconds!

  What You Saw:

  - Prices 1-5 seconds old continuously streaming
  - EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, USD/JPY, AUD/USD, GBP/USD, etc.
  - Bid/Ask updating in sub-second intervals (some as fast as 100ms apart!)
  - ~10-15 new ticks every 3 seconds across all pairs

  The Freshest Data Possible:

  Your system is collecting prices faster than you can read them. Every price you saw was:
  - ✅ 1-4 seconds old when displayed
  - ✅ Directly from OANDA's live stream
  - ✅ Stored in your database with millisecond precision
  - ✅ Ready for algorithmic trading strategies

  Watch It Yourself:

  Continuous live stream (updates every 2 seconds):
  .venv/bin/python scripts/view_live_prices.py

  Or this quick version I just ran:
  watch -n 2 'docker exec trading_timescaledb psql -U trading_user -d trading_db -c "
  SELECT
      TO_CHAR(time, '\''HH24:MI:SS.MS'\'') as \"Time\",
      instrument as \"Pair\",
      ROUND(bid::numeric, 5) as \"Bid\",
      ROUND(ask::numeric, 5) as \"Ask\"
  FROM oanda_pricing
  WHERE time > NOW() - INTERVAL '\''5 seconds'\''
  ORDER BY time DESC
  LIMIT 10;
