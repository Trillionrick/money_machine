Week 1: Data Collection
  - Set up TimescaleDB (run oanda_schema.py SQL)
  - Start collecting forex price data for major pairs
  - Build historical candle database

  Week 2-3: Strategy Testing
  - Run your existing strategies on forex data
  - Test order execution in practice account
  - Adjust position sizing for forex units

  Week 4: Unified Portfolio
  - Implement multi-broker order routing
  - Combine crypto + forex positions
  - Cross-asset risk management

  Week 5+: Production
  - Switch to OANDA_ENVIRONMENT=live
  - Start with small positions
  - Monitor closely

 
  ⚠️ Critical Reminders
  1. Start with Practice Account - Always use OANDA_ENVIRONMENT=practice initially
  2. Review NFA Advisory - Read documentation/customeradvisory_urvct121517.pdf
  3. Forex Trading Hours - Markets closed weekends (Fri 17:00 ET → Sun 17:00 ET)
  4. Margin Requirements - OANDA auto-closes positions if equity < margin
  5. No Order Books - Forex only has bid/ask spreads, not depth
  6. Decimal Precision - JPY pairs use 3 decimals, others use 5

 
  📊 Architecture Highlights

  Multi-Broker Abstraction
  # Same interface for all brokers
  alpaca = AlpacaAdapter(...)
  kraken = KrakenAdapter(...)
  oanda = OandaAdapter(...)

  # All implement ExecutionEngine protocol
  await alpaca.submit_orders([order])
  await oanda.submit_orders([order])

  Unified Data Models
  # OANDA data normalized to your existing types
  from src.core.execution import Order, Fill, Side, OrderType
  from src.core.types import Symbol, Price, Quantity

  # Works seamlessly with existing infrastructure

  Streaming + REST Integration

  # Real-time fills via streaming
  async for fill in adapter.stream_fills():
      process_fill(fill)

  # Historical data via REST
  candles = await market_data.get_candles_paginated(...)

 
  🔍 Code Quality
  All code follows your project's standards:
