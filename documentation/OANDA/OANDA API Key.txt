Overview
Authentication is required to access your live accounts. Personal traders can request a personal access token. If you already have an access token for use with the legacy REST API you can use it with the v20 API too.

OANDA reserves the right to suspend personal access tokens or developer OAuth credentials if necessary based on system stability or other technical issues caused by the customer.

Personal Strategy Traders
A personal access token can be used to access your account through the OANDA v20 API. Once created, a token will grant access to all of your sub-accounts. Please note, your personal access token is like a password, so you should guard it carefully. These tokens are unique to an OANDA account and should be stored securely.

Obtaining a Personal Access Token
There is a link on your OANDA fxTrade account profile page titled “Manage API Access” (My Account -> My Services -> Manage API Access). From there, you can generate a personal access token to use with the OANDA API, as well as revoke a token you may currently have.

Using a Personal Access Token
After generating your token, you should keep it somewhere secure. OANDA does not retain your token so if it is lost or forgotten you must revoke it and generate a new one to keep API access.

In order to use a token to access API resources, you must include the token as a Bearer token in the HTTP Authorization header. As an example:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer e40e15bbe9f0ef2514c830c744ba76c7-1798a5e569420de88803588fca861288" https://api-fxtrade.oanda.com/v3/accounts
