Do I use the requirements.txt and new split structure when I upzip the file after zipping it? 

● After unzipping the backup, use the NEW split structure.

  Here's what will be in the backup:

  money_machine_backup.tar.gz contains:
  ├── requirements.txt              # OLD (bloated, 4.5GB)
  ├── requirements-core.txt         # NEW ✅ (use this)
  ├── requirements-dev.txt          # NEW ✅
  ├── requirements-ml.txt           # NEW ✅
  ├── requirements-analysis.txt     # NEW ✅
  ├── REQUIREMENTS_GUIDE.md         # Instructions
  └── [rest of your code]

  Recovery Process

  1. Extract backup:
  cd /mnt/c/Users/catty/Desktop
  tar -xzf money_machine_backup.tar.gz
  cd money_machine

  2. Create fresh environment:
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate

  3. Install using NEW structure:
  pip install -r requirements-core.txt  # ✅ Use this, not requirements.txt

  4. Optional - add more:
  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # If developing
  pip install -r requirements-ml.txt    # If using ML features

  ---
  The Rule

  - ❌ requirements.txt = Old, deprecated (but kept as reference)
  - ✅ requirements-core.txt = New, use this going forward

  The backup has both, but always use the split structure. The old requirements.txt is just there in case      
  you need to reference it or roll back.

  Think of it like:
  - requirements.txt = Old photo album (keep for memories)
  - requirements-*.txt = New organized albums (use these)
