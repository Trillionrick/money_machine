Commit: Add integration-friendly broker tests with vcrpy cassettes

How do I run this for analysis?

• Use the project venv:
  - Full suite with coverage (replay cassettes, no live calls):
    .venv/bin/python -m pytest
  - Re-record integration cassettes with real endpoints: set creds and RUN_INTEGRATION=1, then run:
    RUN_INTEGRATION=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_broker_integration.py -vv

  That’s all you need to reproduce/verify.
