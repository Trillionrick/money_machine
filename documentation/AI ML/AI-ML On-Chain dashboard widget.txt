 I've created your AI/ML On-Chain dashboard widget with optimal settings for flash loan
  profitability. Here's what you now have:

  🎯 What Was Created

  1. AI/ML On-Chain Control Widget (web_dashboard_ai_onchain.html)

  A powerful dashboard widget that gives you complete control over on-chain flash loan AI settings:

  Features:
  - ⚡ One-Click Presets: Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive buttons
  - 📊 Visual Capital Tracking: Current → Target with growth multiplier display
  - 🎚️ Smart Sliders: AI Confidence (0.50-0.90) and Min Flash Profit (0.05-0.50 ETH)
  - ⚙️ Position Sizing: Kelly Fraction & Max Leverage controls
  - 🛡️ Risk Management: Daily loss limits, concurrent execution controls
  - 📈 Real-Time Stats: Decisions, executions, win rate, progress %
  - 🤖 Feature Toggles: AI Orchestration, Profit Maximization, ML Scoring, Flash Loans

  2. API Endpoints (src/api/ai_onchain_endpoints.py)

  Complete REST API for controlling the AI system:
  - GET /api/ai/onchain/status - System status and configuration
  - GET /api/ai/onchain/stats - Performance metrics and progress
  - GET /api/ai/onchain/config - Current configuration
  - POST /api/ai/onchain/config - Update configuration
  - POST /api/ai/onchain/preset/{name} - Apply preset (conservative/balanced/aggressive)
  - GET /api/ai/onchain/health - Health check with recommendations

  3. Automatic Integration Script (integrate_ai_onchain_dashboard.py)

  One-command installation!

  🚀 Quick Setup (2 Minutes)

  Option 1: Automatic Integration (Recommended)

  # Run the integration script
  python integrate_ai_onchain_dashboard.py

  This automatically:
  1. ✅ Backs up your current dashboard and web server
  2. ✅ Adds the AI/ML on-chain widget to your dashboard
  3. ✅ Mounts the API endpoints in web_server.py
  4. ✅ Shows you next steps

  Option 2: Manual Integration

  If you prefer manual control, see DASHBOARD_AI_ONCHAIN_INTEGRATION.md for step-by-step instructions.

  💰 Configure for Maximum Flash Loan Profit

  🎮 Widget Controls Explained

  AI Confidence Slider

  Lower = More opportunities but riskier
  - 0.50-0.60: Very aggressive, catch everything
  - 0.65-0.75: Balanced, quality opportunities
  - 0.80-0.90: Conservative, only sure wins

  Real-time adjustment: If market is slow, lower it. If too many losses, raise it.

  Min Flash Profit Slider

  Lower = More trades but smaller profits
  - 0.05-0.10 ETH: Many opportunities, small gains
  - 0.15-0.25 ETH: Balanced approach
  - 0.30-0.50 ETH: Fewer but larger profits

  Pro tip: Start at 0.15, lower if < 10 trades/day.

  Kelly Fraction & Max Leverage

  Controls how aggressively the AI sizes positions.

  Kelly Fraction:
  - 0.25 = Standard Kelly (safe)
  - 0.30 = Target-optimized (our AI default)
  - 0.35+ = Very aggressive (max profit mode)

  Max Leverage:
  - 2x = Only use 2x your capital
  - 3-4x = Balanced flash loan size
  - 5-10x = Maximum flash loan leverage

  Example:
  Your Capital: 100 ETH
  Max Leverage: 5x
  → Can borrow up to 500 ETH for flash loans

  Risk Management

  Max Daily Losses:
  - System auto-stops if exceeded
  - Protects against bad market days
  - Resets every 24 hours

  Max Concurrent:
  - How many trades execute simultaneously
  - Higher = more opportunities, more risk
  - Lower = safer, sequential execution

  🎓 Pro Tips

  1. Start Balanced, Not Aggressive
    - Test for 24-48 hours
    - Watch win rate and profits
    - Gradually increase if performing well
  2. Monitor the Progress %
    - 0-10%: Early stage, system learning
    - 10-50%: Mid-game, optimize settings
    - 50-90%: Late game, consider conservative
    - 90%+: Near target, lock in profits!
  3. Adjust Based on Market
    - High volatility? → Lower confidence
    - Low opportunities? → Lower profit threshold
    - Many losses? → Increase confidence
  4. Use the Health API
  curl http://localhost:8080/api/ai/onchain/health
  - Gets recommendations
  - Shows alerts
  - Helps optimize

  5. Train the ML Model
    - Needs 50+ trades minimum
    - Check "ML Model Trained" status
    - Significantly improves accuracy
