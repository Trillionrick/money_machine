I dont's need to touch the "Gas cap ETH (gwei) and "Gas cap Polygon (gwei) inputs?

● Great question! Gas caps are optional but HIGHLY recommended for flash loans. Let me explain:

  ---
  🎯 What Gas Caps Do

  Gas cap ETH (gwei)

  What it does: Sets maximum gas price for Ethereum mainnet trades
  Default: 100 gwei (from your .env: MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI=100)
  If 0 or empty: No cap (will execute at ANY gas price!)

  Example:
  ├─ You set: 50 gwei
  ├─ Current gas: 80 gwei
  └─ Result: Trade BLOCKED ❌ (too expensive)

  Gas cap Polygon (gwei)

  What it does: Sets maximum gas price for Polygon trades
  Default: 120 gwei (from your code)
  Why higher: Polygon gas is much cheaper ($0.01-0.50)

 ⚠️ Why Gas Caps Matter for Flash Loans

  Flash Loans Use MORE Gas:

  Transaction Type          Gas Used    Cost at Different Prices
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Regular DEX swap          150,000     $30 @ 100 gwei
                                        $15 @ 50 gwei
                                        $9  @ 30 gwei

  Flash loan arbitrage      350,000     $70 @ 100 gwei  ← 2.3x more!
                                        $35 @ 50 gwei
                                        $21 @ 30 gwei

  Impact on Your Profits:

  Example: Your 50 bps edge trade (0.5% = $450 on $90k)

  Gas Price    Gas Cost    Net Profit    Profitable?
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  30 gwei      $21         $384          ✅ YES
  50 gwei      $35         $370          ✅ YES
  80 gwei      $56         $349          ✅ YES (barely)
  100 gwei     $70         $335          ✅ YES (thin)
  150 gwei     $105        $300          ⚠️ RISKY
  200 gwei     $140        $265          ⚠️ VERY RISKY
  300 gwei     $210        $195          ❌ NOT WORTH IT

  Plus flash loan fee: -$45
  Net after all costs shown above

  Without a gas cap: Bot might execute at 200+ gwei and barely break even (or lose money!)

  🎯 Recommended Gas Cap Settings

  For Flash Loans on Ethereum:

  Conservative (safest):
  Gas cap ETH: 30 gwei
  ├─ Only executes in quiet periods
  ├─ Higher profit margins
  └─ Fewer opportunities

  Balanced (recommended):
  Gas cap ETH: 50 gwei
  ├─ Good balance of opportunities vs profit
  ├─ Still profitable after fees
  └─ Executes ~40-60% of the time

  Aggressive:
  Gas cap ETH: 80 gwei
  ├─ More opportunities
  ├─ Lower profit margins
  └─ Higher risk of unprofitable trades

  No cap (NOT recommended):
  Gas cap ETH: 0 or 100+
  ├─ Executes even at expensive gas
  └─ ⚠️ Risk of losses!

  For Polygon (if you enable it):

  Gas cap Polygon: 80 gwei
  Why: Polygon gas is cheap (~$0.50 max)
  Not critical: Even at high gwei, still cheap

  ---
  💡 My Recommendation for You

  YES, you should set gas caps!

  Here's what to do:

  Option 1: Conservative Start (Recommended)

  Dashboard settings:
  ├─ Gas cap ETH: 40 gwei
  └─ Gas cap Polygon: 80 gwei

  Result:
  ├─ Fewer trades (1-3 per day)
  ├─ Higher profit per trade ($200-350)
  └─ Very safe

  Option 2: Balanced

  Dashboard settings:
  ├─ Gas cap ETH: 50 gwei
  └─ Gas cap Polygon: 100 gwei

  Result:
  ├─ Moderate trades (3-6 per day)
  ├─ Good profit per trade ($150-250)
  └─ Balanced risk/reward

  Option 3: Monitor First

  Dashboard settings:
  ├─ Gas cap ETH: 0 (no cap)
  └─ Run in DRY RUN mode

  Then:
  1. Watch what gas prices trades would execute at
  2. See if they'd be profitable
  3. Set cap based on observations

  📊 How to Decide Your Gas Cap

  Step 1: Calculate Your Break-Even Gas

  Your typical flash loan trade:
  Edge: 50 bps = $450 gross
  Flash fee: -$45
  Slippage: -$50
  Minimum net profit target: $120 (0.05 ETH)

  Available for gas: $450 - $45 - $50 - $120 = $235

  Gas budget: $235
  Flash loan gas: 350,000 units
  Max gas price: $235 / 350,000 = 67 gwei

  Recommended cap: 50 gwei (safety margin)

  Step 2: Check Historical Gas Prices

  Ethereum gas prices by time:
  ├─ 2-6 AM UTC: 20-40 gwei ✅ (best time!)
  ├─ 6-10 AM UTC: 40-60 gwei ✅ (good)
  ├─ 10 AM-2 PM UTC: 60-80 gwei ⚠️ (okay)
  ├─ 2-6 PM UTC: 80-120 gwei ⚠️ (expensive)
  └─ 6 PM-2 AM UTC: 60-100 gwei ⚠️ (variable)

  Your gas cap: 50 gwei
  Your trade window: ~40-50% of the day ✅

  🎬 What to Do Right Now

  Quick Setup (5 minutes):

  1. Refresh your dashboard (Ctrl+Shift+R)
  2. Scroll to Advanced Configuration
  3. Set gas caps:
  Gas cap ETH (gwei):     50
  Gas cap Polygon (gwei): 80
  4. Click "💾 Apply Config"
  5. Done! ✅

  🔍 How to Monitor If Your Cap Is Good

  After running for a day, check:

  Too restrictive (cap too low):
  Logs show:
  "flash_loan.gas_too_high" (many times)
  "opportunity_detected but blocked by gas cap"

  Dashboard:
  ├─ Opportunities detected: 10
  ├─ Trades executed: 1
  └─ Sign: Cap is TOO LOW

  Fix: Raise gas cap by 10 gwei

  Too loose (cap too high):
  Logs show:
  "flash_loan.execution_success"
  But profits are small: $50-80 per trade

  Dashboard:
  ├─ Trades executed: 8
  ├─ Average profit: $60
  └─ Sign: Cap is TOO HIGH (eating into profits)

  Fix: Lower gas cap by 10 gwei

  Just right:
  Logs show:
  "flash_loan.execution_success"
  Good profits: $150-250 per trade
  Some opportunities blocked by gas

  Dashboard:
  ├─ Opportunities: 8
  ├─ Trades executed: 4-5
  ├─ Average profit: $180
  └─ Sign: Perfect! ✅

  ✅ Bottom Line

  Do you NEED to set gas caps?
  - ❌ No - Bot will work without them
  - ✅ YES, you SHOULD - For profitability!

  My recommendation:
  Set these now:
  ├─ Gas cap ETH: 50 gwei
  └─ Gas cap Polygon: 80 gwei

  Then adjust based on results after 24 hours.

  Why 50 gwei specifically?
  - ✅ Ensures flash loans stay profitable
  - ✅ Blocks execution during expensive periods
  - ✅ Still allows trades ~40-50% of the day
  - ✅ Protects your profits!

  Set it now and forget it! 🎯
