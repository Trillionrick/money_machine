  Step 7: Deploy!

  1. Click the orange "Deploy" button
  2. MetaMask will pop up showing gas estimate
  3. Check the gas fee (should be ~$30-100 depending on network)
  4. Click "Confirm" in MetaMask
  5. Wait 15-60 seconds for confirmation

  Step 8: Save Contract Address

  After deployment, you'll see:
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Deployed Contracts                     │
  ├────────────────────────────────────────┤

  │    ▼                                   │
  └────────────────────────────────────────┘

  1. Click the copy icon next to the contract address
  2. Open your .env file:
  nano .env  # or: code .env
  3. Add this line:
  ARB_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddressHere
  4. Save the file

  ---
  ✅ Verify It Worked

  In Remix:

  You should see your contract in the "Deployed Contracts" section with these functions:
  - ✅ requestFlashLoan
  - ✅ calculateProfitability
  - ✅ simulateArbitrage
  - ✅ owner (should show YOUR address)

  Test It:

  Click on owner function → Should display your wallet address

  🎯 What These Addresses Are

  | Parameter    | What It Is             | Why Needed                  |
  |--------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
  | _aavePool    | Aave V3 Pool (Mainnet) | Where flash loans come from |
  | _uniV3Router | Uniswap V3 Router      | Where to execute swaps      |
  | _weth        | Wrapped ETH Token      | The asset we'll arbitrage   |

  These are official Ethereum mainnet addresses - don't change them!

  ---
  ⚠️ Important Notes

  1. Network Selection

  Make sure MetaMask is on Ethereum Mainnet:
  MetaMask Network: Ethereum Mainnet (Chain ID: 1)

  NOT:
  - ❌ Sepolia Testnet
  - ❌ Polygon
  - ❌ Arbitrum

  2. Gas Costs

  Deployment will cost approximately:
  - Gas fee: $30-$100 (varies with network congestion)
  - No ETH sent to contract (deployment only)

  3. After Deployment

  Your contract will be empty at first. You'll need to:
  1. Add ARB_CONTRACT_ADDRESS to .env
  2. Optionally: Send 0.1-0.5 ETH to the contract for gas reserves
  3. Enable flash loans in your bot

  ---
  🧪 Test Before Mainnet (Optional)

  If you want to test on Sepolia testnet first:

  1. Switch MetaMask to Sepolia
  2. Get free test ETH: https://sepoliafaucet.com
  3. Use these constructor parameters instead:
  _aavePool:      0x6Ae43d3271ff6888e7Fc43Fd7321a503ff738951
  _uniV3Router:   0x3bFA4769FB09eefC5a80d6E87c3B9C650f7Ae48E
  _weth:          0xfFf9976782d46CC05630D1f6eBAb18b2324d6B14
  4. Deploy on Sepolia
  5. Test with fake ETH
  6. When satisfied, deploy on Mainnet

  🎯 Step-by-Step to Copy the Address

  Method 1: Use the Copy Button (Easiest)

  1. Find your deployed contract in the "Deployed Contracts" section
  2. Look for the address that starts with 0x
  3. Click the copy icon (📋) next to the address
  4. Address is now in your clipboard!

  Method 2: Select and Copy

  1. Click once on the contract address (the 0x... text)
  2. It will highlight
  3. Right-click → Copy
  4. Or press Ctrl+C (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+C (Mac)

  Method 3: From MetaMask

  1. Open MetaMask
  2. Click Activity tab
  3. Find your deployment transaction (most recent)
  4. Click on it to see details
  5. Under "Contract Deployment", you'll see the address
  6. Click to copy

  ---
  ✅ What the Address Looks Like

  Your contract address will be exactly 42 characters:

  0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
   ↑
  Starts with "0x" followed by 40 hex characters (0-9, a-f)

  Examples of valid addresses:
  - ✅ 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
  - ✅ 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
  - ✅ 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48

  NOT valid:
  - ❌ 742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb (missing 0x)
  - ❌ 0x742d35Cc (too short)
  - ❌ (memory) (that's just a label, not the address)

  ---
  🔍 Verify Your Contract on Etherscan

  After copying the address, you can also view it on Etherscan:

  1. Go to https://etherscan.io
  2. Paste your contract address in the search bar
  3. Press Enter

  You should see:
  Contract: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Contract                            │
  │ Creator: 0xYourWalletAddress...     │
  │ Txn Hash: 0xabcd1234...             │
  │ Block: 12345678                     │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘

  ---
  📋 After You Copy It

  Once you have the address copied:

  # Open your .env file
  nano .env

  # Find line 130 and replace with your address:
  ARB_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourCopiedAddressHere

  # Save (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

  ---
  🚨 Troubleshooting

  "I don't see Deployed Contracts section!"

  - Make sure deployment succeeded (check MetaMask for confirmation)
  - The section auto-expands after successful deployment
  - Look at the bottom of the left panel in the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab

  "It says 'memory' - is that the address?"

  - No! The address is the 0x... part
  - (memory) is just a label showing it's a local deployment
  - Copy only the 42-character 0x address

  "The address changed when I refreshed Remix!"

  - That's normal for local deployments
  - But if you deployed to Mainnet, the address is permanent
  - Check MetaMask transaction history for the real address
