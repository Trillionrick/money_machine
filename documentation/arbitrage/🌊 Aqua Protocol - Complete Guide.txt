🌊 Aqua Protocol - Complete Guide

  What is Aqua?

  Aqua is a cross-chain liquidity management protocol that allows users to deploy and manage DeFi trading strategies across multiple      
  blockchains from a single smart contract. Your arbitrage system monitors Aqua to detect profitable liquidity movements.

  The 4 Event Types Explained:

  1. Pushed 📥

  What: User deposits tokens into a strategy
  - Tracks: maker address, app address, token, amount
  - Why it matters: Shows capital flowing into strategies
  - Example: Whale deposits 100 ETH into a yield farming strategy

  2. Pulled 📤

  What: User withdraws tokens from a strategy
  - Tracks: maker address, app address, token, amount
  - Why it matters: Shows capital exiting strategies (could indicate profit-taking or risk-off)
  - Example: User pulls 50 USDC profit from an arbitrage strategy

  3. Shipped 🚢

  What: A new strategy is deployed/activated
  - Tracks: maker address, app address, strategy hash (unique ID)
  - Why it matters: New profitable strategies being launched
  - Example: Smart trader deploys a cross-DEX arbitrage strategy

  4. Docked ⚓

  What: A strategy is terminated/closed
  - Tracks: maker address, app address, strategy hash
  - Why it matters: Strategies being shut down (could be unprofitable or completed)
  - Example: Arbitrage strategy completed and positions unwound

  Why Monitor Aqua for Arbitrage?

  1. Copy Trading Opportunities
    - See what profitable traders are doing in real-time
    - Identify successful strategies before they become saturated
  2. Liquidity Flow Intelligence
    - Track where capital is moving across chains
    - Detect market sentiment shifts
  3. Strategy Discovery
    - Learn from strategy hashes of successful traders
    - Reverse-engineer profitable approaches
  4. Flash Loan Signals
    - Large Pushed/Pulled events = liquidity opportunities
    - Shipped events = potential arbitrage setups

  How It Works in Your Dashboard:

  Current Config:
  AQUA_ENABLE=true
  AQUA_CHAINS=ethereum,polygon

  Event Flow:
  1. Your dashboard connects to Ethereum & Polygon RPCs
  2. Watches the Aqua contract for events
  3. Parses events (Pushed/Pulled/Shipped/Docked)
  4. Displays them in real-time in the UI
  5. Stores last 50 events for analysis

  Real-World Example:

  Scenario: Whale Arbitrage Detection
  Event: Pushed
  Maker: 0xWhaleAddress...
  Token: USDC
  Amount: 500,000 USDC
  Chain: Ethereum

  Event: Shipped
  Strategy Hash: 0xabc123...
  Chain: Polygon

  Event: Pulled
  Amount: 525,000 USDC (+5% profit)
  Chain: Polygon

  Your System Detects:
  - Large capital deployment (500k USDC)
  - Cross-chain strategy (Ethereum → Polygon)
  - 5% profit in short timeframe
  - Action: Analyze strategy hash, replicate if profitable
