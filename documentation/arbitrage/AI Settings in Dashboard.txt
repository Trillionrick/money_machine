AI Settings in Dashboard (at http://localhost:8080)

  Your dashboard has a dedicated "🤖 AI Settings (off-chain)" section with 4 key parameters:

  1. AI min profit (ETH)

  - Default: 0.05 ETH
  - Purpose: Minimum profit threshold for AI to approve a trade
  - Config field: aiMinProfitEthInput
  - What it does: AI decider rejects opportunities below this profit level

  2. AI confidence threshold

  - Default: 0.6 (60%)
  - Range: 0.0 to 1.0
  - Purpose: Minimum confidence score for AI to approve
  - Config field: aiConfidenceInput
  - What it does: Combines edge signal + caller confidence; rejects low-confidence trades

  3. AI max gas (gwei)

  - Default: 120 gwei
  - Purpose: Maximum gas price AI will accept
  - Config field: aiMaxGasInput
  - What it does: Protects against executing trades during gas spikes

  4. AI hop penalty (quote units)

  - Default: 0 (disabled)
  - Recommended: 5.0 for multi-hop routes
  - Purpose: Penalty per hop for complex arbitrage paths
  - Config field: aiHopPenaltyInput
  - What it does: Reduces net profit for multi-hop trades (e.g., 2-hop trade loses 5 quote units)

  Environment Variables (Optional Defaults)

  Set these in your .env file to change startup defaults:

  # AI Decider Settings
  AI_MIN_PROFIT_ETH=0.05          # Minimum profit in ETH
  AI_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.6      # Confidence threshold (0-1)
  AI_MAX_GAS_GWEI=120             # Max gas price in gwei
  AI_HOP_PENALTY_QUOTE=5          # Penalty per hop in quote units

  # Flash Loan Settings (synced with AI)
  MIN_FLASH_PROFIT_ETH=0.5        # Flash loan minimum profit
  MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI=120          # Max gas for flash loans

  The dashboard reads these on startup (web_server.py:54-60) and populates the UI fields.

  AI Decision Display

  The dashboard also shows real-time AI decisions in the "🤖 AI Decision" card:
  - Net profit estimate
  - Confidence score
  - Approval/rejection reason

  Configuration flow: Dashboard UI → Apply Config → Backend updates AIConfig → AI Decider uses new thresholds for scoring
