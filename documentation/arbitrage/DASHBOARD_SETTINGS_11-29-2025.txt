Step-by-Step Guide to Enable Auto-Execution

  ⚠️ IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNING ⚠️

  Auto-execution will place REAL TRADES using your wallet funds. Only enable this if:
  - Your wallets have sufficient balances (ETH for gas, stablecoins for trading)
  - You've tested thoroughly in dry-run mode
  - You understand the risks of automated trading
  - Your gas caps and profit thresholds are properly configured

  ---
  📋 Steps to Enable:

  1. Open the Dashboard
  ./start_dashboard.sh
  1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080
  2. Configure Your Safety Settings FIRST

  2. In the Advanced Configuration section, set:
    - Min edge (bps): Minimum profit spread (e.g., 25 = 0.25%)
    - Slippage tolerance: Max acceptable slippage (e.g., 0.01 = 1%)
    - Profit floor (quote/USD): Minimum profit in dollars (e.g., 5.0)
    - Gas cap ETH (gwei): Maximum gas you'll pay (e.g., 50)
    - Gas cap Polygon (gwei): Maximum for Polygon trades (e.g., 100)

  Click 💾 Apply Config after setting these.
  3. Enable Auto-Execution Toggles

  3. In the Controls section:
    - ✅ UNCHECK "Dry run (no live trades)"
    - ✅ CHECK "Auto-execute profitable trades"
    - ✅ CHECK/UNCHECK "Enable flash loans" (based on your preference)
  4. Start the Scanner

  4. Click ▶️ Start Scanner
  5. Verify Status

  5. You should see:
    - Status indicator turns green and shows "Running"
    - Execution mode pill shows "Live auto-execution" (green)
    - Trade status shows "Auto-execution enabled" (green)

  🎯 What Happens When Enabled

  When auto-execution is active:

  1. Opportunity Detection: The scanner continuously monitors CEX vs DEX prices
  2. Threshold Check: When an opportunity meets your configured thresholds (min edge, profit floor, gas cap)
  3. Automatic Execution:
    - DEX side: Swaps tokens on Uniswap/Polygon
    - CEX side: Places sell order on configured exchange (Binance/Alpaca if connected)
    - Flash loans: If edge is large enough and flash loans are enabled, uses flash loan for capital
  4. Trade Logging: All executions appear in "📦 Recent Trades" with:
    - Transaction hashes
    - Profit margins
    - Execution mode (regular/flash loan)

  🔍 Monitoring Active Trades

  Watch these sections:
  - 🎯 Recent Opportunities: Shows detected spreads (even if not executed)
  - 📦 Recent Trades: Shows actual executions with tx hashes
  - ✅ Trades Counter: Total executed trades
  - 💎 Total Profit: Cumulative profit in ETH

  ---
  🛡️ Safety Features

  Even with auto-execute enabled, trades are blocked if:
  - Edge is below your min_edge_bps threshold
  - Gas price exceeds your configured cap
  - Profit is below your profit_floor_quote
  - Wallet balance is insufficient
  - Network issues prevent price fetching

  🚨 Quick Disable

  To stop auto-execution immediately:
  1. Click ⏹️ Stop Scanner button
  2. OR re-check "Dry run" and restart
  3. OR close the dashboard server (Ctrl+C in terminal)

  📊 Recommended First-Time Settings

  For safe initial testing with real execution:

  Min edge (bps):          50    (0.5% minimum spread)
  Slippage tolerance:      0.01  (1%)
  Profit floor (USD):      10.0  (minimum $10 profit)
  Gas cap ETH:             30    (30 gwei max)
  Gas cap Polygon:         80    (80 gwei max)
  Max notional:            100.0 (in config - $100 per trade)

  These conservative settings reduce risk while you monitor actual performance.

  ---
  🧪 Test Progression

  Recommended approach:
  1. ✅ Week 1: Dry run mode - observe opportunities
  2. ✅ Week 2: Enable execution with very conservative thresholds (high min edge, low notional)
  3. ✅ Week 3+: Gradually relax thresholds based on observed profitability

  This way you can validate the system behavior before committing significant capital!
