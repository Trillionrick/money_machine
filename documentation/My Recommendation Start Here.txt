 My Recommendation: Start Here

  If you want to move to production NOW, I suggest this prioritized 90-day roadmap:

  Month 1: Safety & Infrastructure

  1. Implement circuit breakers and position limits
  2. Set up PostgreSQL for trade logging
  3. Create comprehensive monitoring dashboard
  4. Paper trade with real market data feed
  5. Goal: Zero-risk testing environment with production-like conditions

  Month 2: Advanced Intelligence

  1. Integrate real-time DEX liquidity data
  2. Implement market regime detection
  3. Build ensemble ML model (LSTM + XGBoost)
  4. Add pre-trade validation layer
  5. Goal: Smarter decision-making with multi-factor analysis

  Month 3: Controlled Real Deployment

  1. Deploy with $1K test capital
  2. Run conservative mode only (85% confidence threshold)
  3. Manual review of every AI decision for first 100 trades
  4. Gradually increase capital as confidence grows
  5. Goal: Real profits with controlled risk

  💡 Immediate Next Steps (This Week):

  1. Set up proper database: Migrate from in-memory to PostgreSQL
  2. Implement circuit breakers: Daily loss limit = immediate priority
  3. Build backtesting framework: Test strategies on historical data
  4. Private RPC setup: Get Alchemy/Infura premium account
  5. Create paper trading mode: Simulate trades without capital

  Would you like me to help you implement any of these specific components? I can:
  - Build the circuit breaker system
  - Set up PostgreSQL schema for trade tracking
  - Create a backtesting framework
  - Implement market regime detection
  - Design the multi-layer validation system
