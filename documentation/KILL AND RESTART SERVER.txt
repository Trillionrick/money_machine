 Tool use rejected with user message: Just give me the command to kill and restart, please, like I asked.

● Here are the commands:

  # Kill existing dashboard processes
  pkill -f "start_dashboard.sh"
  pkill -f "uvicorn web_server"

  # Or force kill anything on port 8080
  lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9

  # Restart dashboard
  ./start_dashboard.sh

> Can I combine the kill and restart into on command line?

● Yes, here's a one-liner:

  pkill -f "start_dashboard.sh|uvicorn web_server" ; ./start_dashboard.sh

  Or if you want to force kill by port and restart:

  lsof -ti:8080 | xargs -r kill -9 ; ./start_dashboard.sh

  The ; runs the restart regardless of whether anything was killed. Use && instead if you only want to restart if
  the kill succeeds.
